        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-3">
            <li>

            <li>
                <strong>Location services:</strong> If you enable location permissions,
                your location is used solely to show nearby bus stops and calculate
                routes. This data stays on your device and is never transmitted to
                our servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bus data:</strong> The app fetches public bus arrival information
                from the LTA DataMall API using your internet connection. No personal
                information is sent with these requests.
            </li>
